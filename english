so there are two states to each light
on or off
if player One scores the light will go On 
if Player Two scores the light will go off

we can imagine the starting state of the board to be a 5 by 5 grid, making 25 sections with all 25 lights off

whenever either player scores first the final light in the 5,5 position will be removed/deleted
then that position will read the state of the 24th position 4,5

4,5 will be deleted and then read the state of 3,5

3,5 will be deleted and then read the state of 2,5

when 1,5 is deleted it will then read the state of 5,4

and so on.

At the 1,1 position the we record which player scored by now marking the light as on or off.

I'm going to build a demonstration out of X's and O's on a 3x3 grid

We can say that the starting board state is all X's
I'm going to write an imagined game out with players X and O

O scores
X scores
O scores
O scores
X scores
O scores
O scores
X scores
O scores

here are the changes to the board state after each of those moves
